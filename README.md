# pytk_SerialTool
PythonUI

It's for Hardware device debug(MCU for example)
Managed to finish it in the later year

1) Mainwindows.py+ HW_serial.py to create a GUI with buttons, but it has a problem that're unable to show the real time data on figure when it's on GUI canvas area. I guess it's coz matplotlib is just suit static figure/form , maybe.
2) DynamicFigure.py+ HW_serial.py will show the multi-figures on one window.
